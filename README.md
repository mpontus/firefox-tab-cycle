# Tab Cycle

> Cross-platform extension for tab navigation

This extension brings currently active tab to the front thus making it easier to navigate between few most recent tabs.

## Usage 

Switch from N-th most recent buffer with C-<N>/M-<N>:

<<insert gif here>>

Cycle buffers forward with M-n:

<<insert gif here>>

Cycle buffers backward with M-p:

<<insert gif here>>
